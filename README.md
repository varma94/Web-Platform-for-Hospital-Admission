* The Web Platform for Hospital Admission is a web application which gives information about the best hospital for a given disease id. 
* The data was provided by a professor from which we extracted the required data to compute the best hospitals.
* The ranking for each hospital is provided depending on three requirements :

       Mortality Rate
       Cost required for treating a particular disease
       Number of days required to stay at the hospital
 
* All the above factors were taken into consideration and ranking was given.
* This website also displays the same information in the form of statistics for which we have used Google Charts.
* After the development the web page was hosted on the college server at http://omega.uta.edu/~sxv7644/doctor/index.html.
